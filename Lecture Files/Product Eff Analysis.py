# Production Efficiency Analysis

# ----------------------------------------------------
# region Introduction
# ----------------------------------------------------
# In this activity, you are tasked with analyzing production data to calculate the total
# production time for various products and identify if any product's production time exceeds
# a specific efficiency threshold. This will help in identifying products that need process
# optimization.
# Example: Calculating total production time for a single product
production_times = [1.5, 2.3, 0.5]  # Time in hours for each production step
total_time = sum(production_times)
print(f"Total production time: {total_time} hours")

# Below is the production data for several products, with each product having a series of
# production steps and corresponding times in hours. Calculate the total production time for
# each product and identify any products with total production times exceeding 5 hours as
# needing efficiency improvements.

# Production Data (Product Code: [Time in hours for each step])
production_data = {
    'ProdA': [1.0, 2.5, 1.2],
    'ProdB': [3.0, 1.5, 1.0],
    'ProdC': [2.2, 2.0, 0.8]
}

# TODO: Activity - Simplified Efficiency Analysis
# First, calculate the total production time for each product.
# Next, check if the total time exceeds the efficiency threshold of 5 hours.
# Print the product code and its total production time, and indicate if it needs efficiency improvements.
